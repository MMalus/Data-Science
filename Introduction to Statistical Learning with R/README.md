This folder is primarily to contain solutions to the programming exercises from "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R".  Additionally, it contains some other testing I did, such as a neural network solution which significantly improves the results of one problem.  I have taught students from middle school to grad school, and I know that by putting answers online someone will find them and probably use them to cheat on homework or exams.  If you do so, you are damaging your education, wasting whatever money you spent to be enrolled in the class, and wasting your instructor's time.  I cannot stress enough that these answers should be (at most) a guidepost.
