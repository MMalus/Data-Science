# Data-Science

Storage for simple data science tips and tricks, or full projects, that I've dealt with before.  Updated as I sort through the large backlog of stuff I just have sitting on my harddrive.

As of right now (7/3/17) here is the general organizational plan:

-The folder "Introduction to Statistical Learning with R" contains R programming exercise solutions to the textbook of the same name.  It also
includes a few examples where I redid an exercise with a different method (for example a simple NN) to look for improvements and teach myself
some new techniques.

-A folder containing a collection of neat tutorials and cheat sheets that I've either come across or made myself.

-Kaggle junk

Current priority is finishing up the ISLR folder, and putting together a few cheat sheets from my assembled notes.  First sheet will be on 
SQL and is almost done.

Here's a brief list of what I still have to clean up/sort through and upload:

-Chapter solutions from ISLR Chapters 5, 7, 8, 9, 10

-SQL helpful guide and tricks

-Two python done Kaggle competitions

-Some random scripts from CRF stuff
