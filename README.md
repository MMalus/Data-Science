# Data-Science

Storage for simple data science tips and tricks, or full projects, that I've dealt with before.  Updated as I sort through the large backlog of stuff I just have sitting on my harddrive.

Here's a brief list of what I still have to clean up/sort through and upload:

-Chapter solutions from ISLR Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

-SQL helpful guide and tricks

-Two python done Kaggle competitions

-Some random scripts from CRF stuff
